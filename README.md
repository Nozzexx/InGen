# InGen Computer Systems-A Jurassic Park Database
InGen Computer Systems has designed a relational database minicing the backend services for the paleo-biological preserve Jurassic Park. This database system will track a wide range of entities: from Dinosaurs, their Paleo Diets, park attractions, park staff, concessions, merchandise and more.

Each of these entities and their sub entities are mapped for how they relate and interact with each other.
